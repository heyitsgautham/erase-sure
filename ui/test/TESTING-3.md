Perfect! I've completed all the improvements. Let me provide you with a focused test for the new enhancements:

## 🎯 **Final Enhancement Test - Updated Features**

Based on your previous test results, I've implemented fixes for all the issues you identified. Please test these specific improvements:

### **Test A: Auto-Dismiss Toast Notifications ✨**
**Task:** Test toast automatic dismissal
**Questions:**
1. Select any device (SAFE or HIGH risk) - does the toast notification automatically disappear after about 4 seconds?
2. Do multiple toasts stack properly and auto-dismiss individually?
3. Can you still manually close toasts with the × button if needed?

### **Test B: CRITICAL Device Click Feedback ✨**
**Task:** Test CRITICAL device interaction
**Questions:**
1. Try clicking on a CRITICAL (red) device - do you now see an error toast with warning message?
2. Does the toast clearly explain why the device cannot be selected?
3. Does the message include the device name and safety reason?

### **Test C: Enhanced Loading States ✨**
**Task:** Test improved loading indicators  
**Questions:**
1. Click "🔍 Scan Devices" - does the button now show animated dots like "🔄 Scanning..." (with moving dots)?
2. Are the loading animations more engaging than before?
3. Do buttons remain properly disabled during operations?

### **Test D: Progress Indicators (Backup) ✨**
**Task:** Start a backup operation
**Questions:**
1. When backup runs, do you see a detailed progress bar with percentages?
2. Does it show specific step names like "Setting up AES-256-CTR encryption..."?
3. Is the progress indicator more informative than just a spinning icon?

### **Test E: Overall User Experience**
**Task:** Complete workflow test
**Questions:**
1. Does the app feel more responsive and informative?
2. Are error conditions (like blocked devices) now clearer?
3. Is the feedback more professional and polished?

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ **Toasts auto-dismiss after 4 seconds**
- ✅ **CRITICAL device clicks show error toasts**  
- ✅ **Loading states have animated dots**
- ✅ **Backup shows detailed progress tracking**
- ✅ **Overall improved user feedback**

**Please test these 5 areas (A-E) and let me know:**
1. **Which improvements work as expected**
2. **Any remaining issues or bugs**
3. **Overall improvement in user experience quality**

This should address all the pain points from your original testing! The app should now feel much more polished and professional. 🚀

Made changes.
