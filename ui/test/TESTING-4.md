## 🧪 **Final Test Request**

Please test these two specific enhancements:

### **Test A: Enhanced Toast Animations**
1. **Select any device** → Does the toast slide in smoothly from the right?
2. **Let it auto-dismiss** → Does it fade out smoothly instead of disappearing instantly?
3. **Manually close a toast** → Does the × button trigger the same smooth fade-out?

### **Test B: Visual Backup Progress Bar**
1. **Start a backup operation** → Do you now see a visual progress bar with percentages?
2. **Progress updates** → Does it show step names like "Setting up AES-256-CTR encryption..."?
3. **Completion** → Does the progress bar disappear cleanly when backup finishes?

---

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ **Smooth toast fade-in/fade-out animations**
- ✅ **Visual progress bar with steps and percentages**
- ✅ **Professional, polished feel throughout the app**

The SecureWipe application should now have a significantly more polished and professional user experience! 🚀

**Let me know how these final enhancements work and if there are any other UX improvements you'd like to see!**
